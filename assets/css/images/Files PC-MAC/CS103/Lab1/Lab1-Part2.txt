Added <em>,<strong>,<sup>,<hr>,<i>,<b>,<table>.

I have done both Extra Points. On CSS Zen Garden I added a dotted underline under CSS Zen Garden in the header. I did this
by adding the <abbrv> tag that contained a null abbreviation, thus leading me to create a dotted underline without any extra add-ons.
(Note : I checked with Dr.Vahid and he mentioned that the usage of abbrv in this case should be fine and be counted towards the bonus)

Bonus 2:

<strong>,<b> and <em>,<i> fundemntally do the same thing. Strong and b both make characters appear bold, whereas both em and i make
characters italic. The diffrence between them is distinction. b and i are used when you want to make something bold or italic respectively
but for no special reason other than the asthetic change. With <strong> and <em>, however, you are distinctly saying that the text these
tags encompass require special attention and are thus changed visually for that reason. It helps screenreaders indetify an emphasize on 
important text, and helps one distinctly tell if something is bold/italic because it looks cool or if its bold/italic because it means
something important.
