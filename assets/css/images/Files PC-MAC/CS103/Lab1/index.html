        <h3>!السلام عليكم</h3>


        <p>Hello there! I'm <strong>Majid,</strong> an undergrad in Boston University <i>(Class of 2025)</i>.
        I'm majoring in Electrical Engineering, and have a massive interest in Computer Science/Engineering.
        I've participated - and won - in a variety of different technological innovation competitions, and am
        always on the look out to participate in more.</p>
        <br>

        <p>You'll probably see me around campus, especially near the Photonics Center at <em>8th S.t Mary St</em>. If you do,
          please do not hesitate to stop me and say hello. Here's a couple of things you can mention during such an encounter :</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>"Wow, your HTML page was awesome!"</b></li>
            <li><b>"Nice weather we're having, eh?"</b><i><sup>if you ignore all this snow</sup></i></li>
            <li><b>"Man, Tax Evasion is neat!"*</b></li>
          </ul>

          <p><i>*I'm on a Student Visa and am not required to pay taxes.</i></p>

          <table border="5" cellpadding="5" width="100%">
            <tr>
              <td>Study Location</td>
              <td>Probability of My Presence</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><a href="https://www.bu.edu/eng/current-students/ingalls/">Ingalls Engineering Resource Center</a></td>
              <td>100%. You'll find me whenever you look. If I am not there then you are not in Ingalls</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Timbuktu, Mali</td>
              <td>0%. I don't even know where Timbuktu is on a map, I just added the location to make Ingalls feel like a less lonely element</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br>

          <p>Thank you for reading my page until the end. I'll accept all criticism & suggestions on this email : <strong>[majidmuh@bu.edu]</strong></p>

          <p>Feel free to contact me through the same address. Have a wonderful day!</p>
