                                        <p>Many instruments originate in the Middle East region. Most popular of the
                                            stringed instruments is the oud, a pear-shaped lute that traditionally
                                            had four strings, although current instruments have up to six courses
                                            consisting of one or two strings each.
                                            Middle Eastern music also makes use of the violin, which is European in
                                            origin. The violin was adopted into Middle Eastern music in the 19th
                                            century, and it is able to produce non-Western scales that include
                                            quarter-tones because it is fretless.

                                            dance is performed with two rows of men
                                            opposite of one another, each of whom may or may not be wielding a sword
                                            or cane, and is accompanied by drums
                                            and spoken poetry. Originally, the "ardah" was performed only by males
                                            of tribes of the Arabian Peninsula before
                                            going to war, but nowadays it is done at celebrations, weddings, and
                                            national and cultural events by males of all tribes. </p>

                                            Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The name of
                                            the dance literally means "gulf" in Arabic and
                                            it is performed by women at weddings and other social events. Over time
                                            it gained popularity among belly dancers. This
                                            dance entails rows of women in close proximity to one another who move
                                            in a slow, shuffling fashion while rhythmically
                                            swaying their hair. Women's hips mainly remain stationary while
                                            performing this dance. The costume is an important aspect
                                            of this dance; it is associated mostly with colorful embroidered
                                            garments. Many regional variations of this dance are practised.

                                        <p>The Middle East has a rich variety when it comes to fashion. Each country
                                            has its own taste even when wearing the same clothes. Here are some of
                                            the popular clothes you might find in the Middle East</p>

                                        <h2>Thawb</h2>
                                        <p>Thawb, also spelled thobe or tobe and known by various other names in
                                            different regions, is an ankle-length robe, usually with long sleeves.
                                            It is commonly worn in the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East,
                                            neighbouring Arab countries, and some countries in East and West Africa.
                                            Commonly used as an official dress in the Gulf countries just like a
                                            suit in western countries.
                                        </p>
                                        <hr>

                                        <h2>Jalabiya</h2>
                                        <p>The jalabiya is a loose-fitting, traditional Egyptian garment from the
                                            Nile
                                            Valley. The
                                            colorful Egyptian style is worn by both men and women.

                                            The jalabiya differs from the Arabic thawb, as it has a wider cut, no
                                            collar (in some cases, no buttons) and longer, wider sleeves. Mostly
                                            worn in non official settings.

                                        <h2>Shemagh</h2>
                                        <p>The Shemagh is a head dress usually made out of cotton and decorated with
                                            different colors including red, white, black and white. The designs are
                                            usually square shaped. The Shemagh is worn on the head in a triangle
                                            shape. In the Gulf countries, it is usually worn with a Thawb as part of
                                            the official dress.</p>

                                        <p>The Middle Eastern cultures have many differences compared to Western
                                            cultures. The traditions of the Middle Eastern cultures are deeply
                                            connected to religion. Ettiquite, and holidays are a results of culture
                                            and religion mixing together for hundreds of years.

                                            <li>In Islam, it is prefered to use your right hand to your left when
