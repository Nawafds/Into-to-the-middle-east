    <p>Boston, officially the City of Boston, is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
        in the United States and 24th-most populous city in the country. The city proper covers about 48.4 square miles
        with a population of 675,647 in 2020, also making it the most populous city in New England.

    <p style="font-size: 40px; padding-bottom: 20px;  padding-top: 20px">Indigenous peoples</p>
    <p>
        Prior to European colonization, modern-day Boston was originally inhabited by the indigenous
        Massachusett. There were small Native communities throughout what became Boston, who likely
        moved between winter homes inland along the Charles River (called Quinobequin, meaning
        "meandering," by
        the Native people), where hunting was plentiful and summer homes along the coast where fishing
        and
        shellfish beds were plentiful. Through archeological excavations, one of the oldest Native
        fishweirs in New England was found on Boylston Street. Native people constructed it to trap fish
        several
        thousand years ago.

    <p style="font-size: 40px; padding-bottom: 20px;  padding-top: 20px">Colonial
    </p>
    <p>
        Boston's early European settlers had first called the area Trimountaine (after its "three
        mountains",
        only traces of which remain today) but later renamed it Boston after Boston, Lincolnshire,
        England, the
        origin of several prominent colonists. The renaming on September 7, 1630 (Old Style), was by
        Puritan colonists from England who had moved over from Charlestown earlier that year in quest
        for fresh water. Their settlement was initially limited to the Shawmut Peninsula, at that time
        surrounded by the Massachusetts Bay and Charles River and connected to the mainland by a narrow
        isthmus.
        The peninsula is thought to have been inhabited as early as 4000 BCE.
        In 1629, the Massachusetts Bay Colony's first governor John Winthrop led the signing of the
        Cambridge
        Agreement, a key founding document of the city. Puritan ethics and their focus on education
        influenced
        its early history; America's first public school, Boston Latin School, was founded in Boston in
        1635.

    <p style="font-size: 40px; padding-bottom: 20px;  padding-top: 20px">Revolution and the siege of Boston
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of the crucial events of the American Revolution occurred in or near Boston. Boston's
        penchant
        for mob action along with the colonists' growing lack of faith in either Britain or its
        Parliament
        fostered a revolutionary spirit in the city. When the British parliament passed the Stamp
        Act in
        1765, a Boston mob ravaged the homes of Andrew Oliver, the official tasked with enforcing the
        Act, and
        Thomas Hutchinson, then the Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts. The British sent two
        regiments
        to Boston in 1768 in an attempt to quell the angry colonists. This did not sit well with the
        colonists.
        In 1770, during the Boston Massacre, British troops shot into a crowd that had started to
        violently
        harass them. The colonists compelled the British to withdraw their troops. The event was widely
        publicized and fueled a revolutionary movement in America.
