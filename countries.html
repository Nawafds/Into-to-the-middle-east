                                        <p>Saudi Arabia, officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), is a
                                            country on the Arabian Peninsula in Western Asia. It has a land area of
                                            about 2,150,000 km<sup>2</sup> (830,000 sq mi), making it the fifth-largest
                                            country in
                                            Asia, the second-largest in the Arab world, and the largest in Western Asia.
                                            It is bordered by the Red Sea to the west, Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait to the
                                            north, the Persian Gulf, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates to the east,
                                            Oman to the southeast, and Yemen to the south. Bahrain is an island country
                                            off the east coast. The Gulf of Aqaba in the northwest separates Saudi
                                            Arabia from Egypt and Israel. Saudi Arabia is the only country with a
                                            coastline along both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, and most of its
                                            terrain consists of arid desert, lowland, steppe, and mountains. Its capital
                                            and largest city is Riyadh. The country is home to Mecca and Medina, the two
                                            holiest cities in Islam.</p>

                                        <p>The United Arab Emirates, or simply the Emirates, is a country in Western
                                            Asia. It is located at the eastern end
                                            of the Arabian Peninsula, and shares borders with Oman and Saudi Arabia,
                                            while having maritime borders in the Arab Gulf with Qatar and Iran. Abu
                                            Dhabi is the nation's capital, while Dubai, the most populous city, is an
                                            international hub. The United Arab Emirates is an elective monarchy formed
                                            from a federation of seven emirates, consisting of Abu Dhabi (The capital),
                                            Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain. Each
                                            emirate is governed by an Emir and, together, they form the Federal Supreme
                                            Council; one of them serves as President of the United Arab Emirates. In
                                            2013, the country had a population of 9.2 million, of which 1.4 million were
                                            Emirati citizens and 7.8 million were expatriates. As of 2020,
                                            the United Arab Emirates has an estimated population of roughly 9.9
                                            million.

                                        <h1>Geography of Qatar</h1>
                                        <p>Qatar; officially the State of Qatar, is a
                                            country in Western Asia. It occupies the small Qatar Peninsula on the
                                            northeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, and shares its sole land border
                                            with neighbouring Gulf Cooperation Council monarchy Saudi Arabia to the
                                            south, with the rest of its territory surrounded by the Persian Gulf. The
                                            Gulf of Bahrain, an inlet of the Arab Gulf, separates Qatar from nearby
                                            Bahrain. The capital is Doha, home to over 80% of the nation's population.

                                            In early 2017, Qatar's total population was 2.6 million: 313,000 Qatari
                                            citizens and 2.3 million expatriates. Its official religion is
                                            Islam. In terms of income, the country has the fourth-highest GDP (PPP)
                                            per capita in the world, and the sixth-highest GNI per capita (Atlas
                                            method). Qatar is classified by the United Nations as a country of very
                                            high human development, having the third-highest HDI in the Arab world.
                                            It is a high-income economy, backed by the world's third-largest natural gas
                                            reserves and oil reserves. Qatar is the world's largest exporter of
                                            liquefied natural gas, and the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide
                                            per capita.

                                        <p>Egypt, officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country
                                            spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia via a
                                            land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. It is bordered by the
                                            Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Gaza Strip (Palestine) and Israel to the
                                            northeast, the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the
                                            west. The Gulf of Aqaba in the northeast separates Egypt from Jordan and
                                            Saudi Arabia. Cairo is the capital and largest city of Egypt, while
                                            Alexandria, the second-largest city, is an important industrial and tourist
                                            hub at the Mediterranean coast. At approximately 100 million
                                            inhabitants, Egypt is the 14th-most populated country in the world.

                                            Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country, tracing its heritage
                                            along the Nile Delta back to the 6th–4th millennia BCE. Considered a cradle
                                            of civilisation, Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of
                                            writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central
                                            government. Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great
                                            Sphinx, as well the ruins of Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the Valley of the
                                            Kings, reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and
                                            popular interest. Egypt's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral
                                            part of its national identity, which reflects its unique transcontinental
                                            location being simultaneously Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and North
                                            African. Egypt was an early and important centre of Christianity, but
                                            was largely Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly
                                            Sunni Muslim country, albeit with a significant Christian minority, along
                                            with other lesser practiced faiths.

                                        <p>Iran, also called Persia, and
                                            officially the Islamic Republic of Iran, is a country in Western Asia. It
                                            is bordered to the west by Iraq and Turkey, to the northwest by Azerbaijan
                                            and Armenia, to the north by the Caspian Sea and Turkmenistan, to the east
                                            by Afghanistan and Pakistan, and to the south by the Gulf of Oman and the
                                            Persian Gulf. Iran covers an area of 1,648,195 km2 (636,372 sq mi), making
                                            it the fourth-largest country entirely in Asia and the second-largest in
                                            Western Asia. It has a population of 85 million, making it the 17th-most
                                            populous country in the world. Its capital and largest city is Tehran.

                                            Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning
                                            with the formation of the Elamite kingdoms in the fourth millennium BC. It
                                            was first unified by the Iranian Medes in the seventh century BC, and
                                            reached its territorial height in the sixth century BC, when Cyrus the Great
                                            founded the Achaemenid Empire, which became one of the largest empires in
                                            history and has been described as the world's first superpower. The
                                            empire fell to Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC and was divided
                                            into several Hellenistic states. An Iranian rebellion established the
                                            Parthian Empire in the third century BC, which was succeeded in the third
                                            century AD by the Sasanian Empire, a major world power for the next four
                                            centuries. Arab Muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century
                                            AD, which led to the Islamization of Iran. It subsequently became a major
                                            center of Islamic culture and learning, with its art, literature,
                                            philosophy, and architecture spreading across the Muslim world and beyond
                                            during the Islamic Golden Age. Over the next two centuries, a series of
                                            native Muslim dynasties emerged before the Seljuq Turks and the Mongols
                                            conquered the region. In the 15th century, the native Safavids
                                            re-established a unified Iranian state and national identity and
                                            converted the country to Shia Islam. Under the reign of Nader Shah in
                                            the 18th century, Iran once again became a major world power, though by
                                            the 19th century a series of conflicts with Russia led to significant
                                            territorial losses. The early 20th century saw the Persian
                                            Constitutional Revolution. Efforts to nationalize its fossil fuel supply
                                            from Western companies led to an Anglo-American coup in 1953, which resulted
                                            in greater autocratic rule under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and growing Western
                                            political influence. He went on to launch a far-reaching series of
                                            reforms in 1963. After the Iranian Revolution, the current Islamic
                                            Republic was established in 1979 by Ruhollah Khomeini, who became the
                                            country's first Supreme Leader.

                                        <p>Lebanon, officially
                                            the Republic of Lebanon or the Lebanese Republic, is a country in Western
                                            Asia. It is located between Syria to the north and east and Israel to the
                                            south, while Cyprus lies to its west across the Mediterranean Sea; its
                                            location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian
                                            hinterland has contributed to its rich history and shaped a cultural
                                            identity of religious diversity. Lebanon is home to roughly six million
                                            people and covers an area of 10,452 square kilometres (4,036 sq mi), making
                                            it one of the smallest countries in the world. The official language of the
                                            state is Arabic, while French is also formally recognized; the Lebanese
                                            dialect of Arabic is used alongside Modern Standard Arabic throughout the
                                            country.

                                            The earliest evidence of civilization in Lebanon dates back over 7000 years,
                                            predating recorded history. Modern-day Lebanon was home to the
                                            Phoenicians, a maritime culture that flourished for almost 3000 years
                                            (c. 3200–539 BCE). In 64 BCE, the Roman Empire conquered the region, and it
                                            eventually became among the empire's leading centers of Christianity.
                                            The Mount Lebanon range saw the emergence of a monastic tradition known as
                                            the Maronite Church. Upon the region's conquest by the early Arab Muslims,
                                            the Maronites held onto their religion and identity. However, a new
                                            religious group known as the Druze eventually established themselves in
                                            Mount Lebanon as well, generating a religious divide that has lasted for
                                            centuries. During the Crusades, the Maronites re-established contact with
                                            the Roman Catholic Church and asserted their communion with Rome. The
                                            Maronite Catholic and the Druze founded modern Lebanon in the early
                                            eighteenth century, through the ruling and social system known as the
                                            "Maronite-Druze dualism" in Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate.
